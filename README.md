In this example, we are setting the priority level of the ticket. The priority has been set to Emergency since we are dealing with an issue that can affect an entire portion of the business. We have changed the SLA plan and assigned the ticket to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers can set their own SLA plans.
